# Smart-Home-Management-System-STM32-
This project creates an embedded system for controlling various aspects of a connected home, including temperature, lighting, and security. Using sensors (temperature, light, PIR, magnetic) and the STM32F4 microcontroller, data is transmitted to the cloud via ESP8266 for remote monitoring and control.
